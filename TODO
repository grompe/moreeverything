  - add rare skulls drop

- Make a plugin for NEI to allow adding new item IDs easily


Hard/Tricky/Unknown

  (don't use "Packages." construct, try to fix Forge or modify Rhino)

- Dispenser planting seeds

- Hook CommandBase/ICommand to be Minecraft version independent

- Wrap ItemStack and Method in JavaScript pseudo-classes for more straightforward work
  Alternatively, find out if it's possible to add fields into these specifically for JS engine

Maintenance/Boring
==================

- make lava update properly and disappear when source block is removed, for Minecraft 1.5.2 and older
  (https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MC-4631)
- plant more stuff in pots
- villagers drop last trade (if it's enabled) when killed by a player?
- villagers show a bubble with last viewed offer
- on medium and especially hard difficulty, regenerating from full hunger bar makes player hungry
- charge double amount of XP instead of showing "too expensive!" on anvils
- change fishing interval?
- chicken mating makes an egg instead of a chicken;
  if possible, such an egg has 1/2 chance to hatch as opposed to 1/8
  if possible, such an egg hatches instead of disappearing in 5 minutes 
- use lapis in brewing potions?
- make bookshelves have direction
- support Better Than Wolves
