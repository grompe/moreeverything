Easy
====
- Add Equivalent Exchange support for some other mods:
  ExtraBiomes and BOP logs/wood, saplings,

- Add Thaumcraft aspects for mod items/blocks

- Convert __getFile() and __findMatch() to JavaScript, put __getConfigDir()

- Make recipe for Underground Biomes limestone block -> MineFantasy 4 limestone hunks


Medium
======
- Use Forge's adding trades


Hard/Tricky/Unknown
===================
- Hook CommandBase/ICommand to be Minecraft version independent

- Figure out how to access ModLoader in Packages for easier API access,
  considering that Forge moves it from the classpath
  Basically convert between java.lang.Class and JavaClass.
  (Class -> JavaClass: WrapFactory.wrapJavaClass()?)
  (JavaClass -> Class: getClassObject() or unwrap()?)


Maintenance/Boring
==================
- Ensure correct mod load order

- Wrap ItemStack and Method in JavaScript pseudo-classes for more straightforward work
  Alternatively, find out if it's possible to add fields into these specifically for JS engine

- Write introduction, documentation, etc.

- Allow to easily turn off certain tweaks by main configuration script.

- Fix the case when exceptions occur and script still reports 0 warnings 0 errors.


Future
======
- more Thaumcraft API support
- existing IDs, recipes inspection to help adding missing ones
- dispenser planting seeds
- allow changing chests loot
- allow changing mob drops
  - also rare skulls drop?
- allow nether warts to grow in overworld, if shielded from sky and having light level 15
- make lava update properly and disappear when source block is removed, for Minecraft 1.5.2 and older
  (https://mojang.atlassian.net/browse/MC-4631)
- plant more stuff in pots
- villagers drop last trade (if it's enabled) when killed by a player?
- villagers show a bubble with last viewed offer
- on medium and especially hard difficulty, regenerating from full hunger bar makes player hungry
- charge double amount of XP instead of showing "too expensive!" on anvils
- change fishing interval?
- chicken mating makes an egg instead of a chicken;
  if possible, such an egg has 1/2 chance to hatch as opposed to 1/8
  if possible, such an egg hatches instead of disappearing in 5 minutes 
- use lapis in brewing potions?
- make bookshelves have direction
