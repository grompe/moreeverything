Goals of the mod
================
1. Never depend on Minecraft version, don't break on updates.
   Only in cases of drastic feature change.
2. Enhance original Minecraft experience.
3. Enhance experience with Minecraft mods.
4. Prevent gameplay imbalance and use common sense.
5, Be open, flexible, customizable and compatible (Now it is YOURCRAFT!).
6. Be small, fast and straight to the point.


What this mod is not
====================
This is not a tool to create your own mods. It's only for tweaks.
Granted, there are many mods out there that are worth only for tweaks.
This mod can indeed eventually replace them.


Current features
================
tweaks_vanilla.js:
- Allows additional Minecraft blocks and items to be used as furnace fuel
- Allows bleaching wool with bone meal
tweaks_mods.js:
- Allows some mods' blocks and items to be used as furnace fuel
- Adds recipes for using mods' blocks and items between mods
equivalent_exchange.js:
- Adds Equivalent Exchange 3 transmutations for various blocks and items,
  including other mods
thaumcraft.js:
- Adds Thaumcraft aspects for various blocks and items from other mods
- If Minecraft version is compatible (limitation will be lifted eventually),
  adds /eval command to execute JavaScript code
- Works on any not too ancient Minecraft version
  (tested on beta 1.6.4, 1.0.0, 1.2.5, 1.3.2, 1.4.x, 1.5.x)
  Probably beta 1.4 is the earliest possible to run it with.
